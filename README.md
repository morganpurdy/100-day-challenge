# 100-day-challenge
## Day 1
Today I am just working on finishing up some lessons I started in Codecademy. I did the git series and want to wrap up the command line since I decided to tackle the developer way of putting things in github.
I am just trying to get used to using a new text editor and getting the feel back for the command line. I used to know it so much better! Once I wrap up the command line lessons I am going to jump into freecodecamp.org and work through their HTML/CSS lessons.


## Day 2
On day two I am just continuing with the command line lessons in Codecademy. I am learning about input and output redirections and creating an environment in the terminal. I am hoping to finish up this module today and start with the freecodecamp.org lessons tomorrow!
