# 100-day-challenge
## Day 1
Today I am just working on finishing up some lessons I started in Codecademy. I did the git series and want to wrap up the command line since I decided to tackle the developer way of putting things in github.
I am just trying to get used to using a new text editor and getting the feel back for the command line. I used to know it so much better! Once I wrap up the command line lessons I am going to jump into freecodecamp.org and work through their HTML/CSS lessons.


## Day 2
On day two I am just continuing with the command line lessons in Codecademy. I am learning about input and output redirections and creating an environment in the terminal. I am hoping to finish up this module today and start with the freecodecamp.org lessons tomorrow!

## Day 3
Today I finished the command line lessons in Codecademy! Very excited to be done with that and to head into the freecodecamp.org lessons. I started on those before the challenge since I was already a little familiar with HTML and CSS. Looks like tomorrow I will start with "Nest Many Elements within a Single Div Element". I'm excited! Can't wait to get through the HTML/CSS part though to get onto the next chunk, which is Responsive Design with Bootstrap!

## Day 4
What a day! Had to squeeze in some coding time around other activities so did some work while at the mechanic today. Not a lot to report so only a quick update tonight. I did get through the end of the HTML/CSS lessons on freecodecamp.org though! That is exciting enough. I started in on the responsive design section and I am excited to review what I learned tomorrow and dive even deeper. It is not as complicated as I remember it! I do think I will have to do extra reviewing on the column system set up though.

## Day 5
Didn't get the chance to do much today but at least wanted to check in. I took a couple notes about responsive design with bootstrap but I plan on really putting in some time tomorrow!

## Day 6
Today I finsihed up the freecodecamp.org lessons on Responsive design and bootstrap! It's amazing how much you can do with bootstrap and how simple it can make things. I did have a couple questions as I was working through some of the lessons. The first was with the columns to build in a bootstrap grid.
**1. How do you decide when to use each grid size?**
In the lesson I was working with a simulated phone screen, so I used the xs size. And it said (I think) md (medium) is used for laptop screens. But how do I decide which one to use? A couple lessons later the span tag was mentioned. It did say that span can help you style different parts of the same element differently. **But why use a span tag over a div class or div id?** Just some thoughts. Maybe it will become more clear as I continue. Can't wait to start on the jQuery lessons tomorrow!

## Day 7
I took a short dive into jQuery today! I feel like I didn't have enough time and attention to focus on it so I'm going to come back to some lessons tomorrow. I think I understand more about span vs. div class and div id question I was wondering about yesterday. Definitely the id part! Not sure about class vs. span still. I am finally off work tomorrow so I will have more time to dedicate to coding, yay!

## Day 8
This morning I have already worked through all the jQuery lessons in freecodecamp! That means I am about to start on my first true self-coded project next. I will be building a **TRIBUTE PAGE**. I will be working on it in CodePen, which I have never used before. But I am excited. In order to complete the challenge I have to meet the following requirements/user stories (? something I am reading more about today too) on my Tribute page:
1. User Story: I can view a tribute page with an image and text.
2. User Story: I can click on a link that will take me to an external website with further information on the topic.

It says next: "Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck." Even though troubleshooting may seem boring, I am also looking forward to working through any issues that may arise while I am working on my project. Being able to google the right things and solve a problem is a crucial step to becoming a developer! Can't wait to get started on the Tribute page.

Tonight I worked on coding my tribute page. I decided to dedicate my page to Naomi Parker Fraley, the real life inspiration behind Rosie the Riveter! As I have been working I came across some things I wanted to note here to come back to later. At first, I had trouble making the main image both responsive AND centered. Seemed like it should be simple! I had the class of img-responsive, center-block, and smaller-img (one I had set earlier to fix the size of the image since it was so large). Img-responsive was not making my image be responsive. I am still not sure what that was about. But I changed the class to img-fluid instead and that made it responsive! It still wasn't centering properly, however. Then it dawned on me! The smaller-img class had set the size earlier to be fixed at 500px. Once I removed that, I had a responsive image that always was centered and filled the frame. I still wonder about having a smaller image that would be always centered AND responsive. I'm not sure that's a thing people want? Like in responsive land, it would size down but maybe not size up over a certain width but then remain centered at that width? I'm not sure. But I was glad to work through this small issue.

Either way, I hope to finish up my tribute page tomorrow after sleeping on it for a bit!

## Day 9
Today I finished a thing! Last night I started on Tribute Page as part of challenge for Freecodecamp. It is pretty basic and only had two requirements: The user can view a tribute page with an image and text, and they can click on a link that will take  them to a new page for more information. I finished it up today after some more tweaks this morning. I did discover an answer to a question I had yesterday. Img-responsive is now Img-fluid in Bootstrap 4. So that explains why that wasn't working. I figured out how to keep my image centered at wider screen widths too! It's not a perfect project but I think it is definitely a good accomplishment for my first one.

Up next is building a **PERSONAL PORTFOLIO WEBSITE**. Honestly this is what I was looking most forward to entering the freecodecamp program and this 100 day challenge. At first the example looks a little daunting. But I am excited to jump in! Here are the requirements/user stories:
1. User Story: I can access all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling.
2. User Story: I can click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages.
3. User Story: I can see thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built (if you haven't built any websites before, use placeholders.)
4. User Story: I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.

Those seem like some tricky requirements! But I am looking forward to giving it a shot.

## Day 10
Today I started working on my portfolio website! It is going to be a lot more in depth and intense than the tribute page. I spent a significant amount of time today working on the nav bar. I had to use several resources to help me through it, including the Bootstrap documentation and w3 schools, another really helpful website! After some reading, and copy and pasting, I finally got one up and working. I want to take a deeper look at it another day though to make sure I understand how (most of it at least) works, rather than just relying on copying and pasting some code.  

## Day 11
I did not have a lot of time to work on coding today. I squeezed in some time at work and added on to my portfolio site. I added a couple sections including web examples, contact and about me. In the contact area I am adding a form section that I intend to use as an area that people viewing my portfolio can reach out to me. I added three fields with text, including 'name', 'subject', and 'message'. I plan to improve it in the next couple days.

## Day 12
I like to check in every day because it kind of forces me to do something worth writing about. So today in the little down time at work I had, I looked a little more into contact forms in Bootstrap. I tweaked the contact form a little on my portfolio page. I learned that the form-control class makes the form part take up 100% of the width of wherever it is. So that's cool! I also made the "message" part of my form be 'textarea' as opposed to 'input' so it could appear deeper. Just little things, but one step at a time.


## Day 14
So I missed out working on any coding yesterday. It was just a busy day! And I had hardly any time today to do anything but I squeezed in a little work. I added to the "about me" portion of my portfolio page. I summarized my experience and then I wanted to add Font Awesome social media buttons, but those gave me trouble. Haven't been able to solve that yet. I am wondering if Codepen is just a little weird about them? I don't think I'll have a ton of time tonight or tomorrow to figure it out. But then I am off Monday and Tuesday so I hope to take advantage of those days!

## Day 15
Today I spent my hour chatting with other people involved with the 100 day challenge. It was really cool to hear about their experiences and what they are learning about and building. The two people I talked to are involved with coding programs in school or online. It makes me think more about the industry and its challenges, but in a good way I think. I feel inspired and rededicated to the challenge after a day like today! I am excited I have tomorrow off to spend some time getting back to my portfolio site. The few bugs I am focused on working out are:
* Making images actually appear not just on my personal computer. Right now I link to them through a dropbox account. Could it be in privacy settings?
* Figuring out how to set up a form. It must involve a database of some sort. But it would be cool to get to the bottom of that!
* Using Font awesome icons to link to my social media accounts on my portfolio. There was a lesson on the icons in Freecodecamp but it's not working quite right in Codepen.

Maybe tomorrow I can also look up some articles about being a self-taught coder/developer! Maybe that will encourage me a little more each day.

## Day 16
I solved two of the problems I noted yesterday with my portfolio site! First- the images I was hosting through Dropbox weren't showing up because of a privacy setting, sort of as I suspected. Dropbox changed the way they do their public folders so that won't work anymore. I did a quick search for "free image hosting" and found an uploader that seems to be working for now, but we'll see. Seems like just a quick fix for now, I will want to look for a betters solution in the future. Second- those pesky Font awesome icons. So I had linked to font awesome through the CSS and Javascript setting section in Codepen. And it still wasn't working. But after starting at the Font Awesome home page, I saw a link that was for "Use Font Awesome Free CDN". It was a script tag, so I pasted it in the HTML "head stuff" setting in Codepen, and BOOM! The icons appeared. The different ways of using Font Awesome are all a little jargon-y for me, like 'content delivery network' vs. SVG with JS (why I thought I needed to link to it in the Javascript section too) vs. downloading it. But the point is, it works for now!

Going through Codepen and FreeCodeCamp though, I think they do a small disservice to users by not going over the fundamentals of an HTML document from the start, like DOCTYPE and how to link to a stylesheet. In Codepen you just start right away with Divs and containers and other tags/classes because the Head stuff is just out of sight, out of mind. But the head data/stuff it is an important part of starting an HTML document from scratch. Just a thought.

Going forward, **here are a few more things I want to do on my portfolio site:**
* Add more of the projects I did in college to the "web examples" portion of my site. This will mean figuring out how to get them to Github and doing a github project page for them! Right now they are only displaying in Safari so that is a little confusing to me.
* Figuring out that contact form! I think for now I will just have to sit tight with the appearance of a contact form. Seems like I could actually get it to function once I get into the Javascript part of the FreeCodeCamp challenges.
* Understanding more about the collapsable nav bar. Today I noticed it collapses correctly and actually displays a drop down menu when you click the button. I'm not sure how that happened. Maybe a certain class I added today helped? I want to look more into the collapsing and breakpoints and such.

## Day 17
I bounced around a little today with what I was focusing on. Weirdly whatever issue was causing my old projects not to load in chrome was fine today! Everything popped up and worked. So I added another project to my "web examples" part of my portfolio. It is a map graphic I built for the print paper in college that I transferred to online to practice my coding skills. It uses tooltips to indicate different areas of Missouri that were in a drought at the time. When hovered over, the dot displays the city and a picture of that city. Very cool! I played around with some of the code today as a refresher. The only issue I am having is that the tooltips aren't responsive? If that's a thing. The image it is built off of will size down but then the tool tips are not on the right location. I think I will have to come back to that after some more Javascript maybe.

The other thing I worked on today was publishing my Tribute page on github pages. I think I did it wrong. I feel like it shouldn't be this complicated, but I can't get my Tribute page to publish. I have been troubleshooting a little but haven't been able to get to the bottom of it. I am going to continue working on that today in the hopes that I can figure it out.

## Day 18
Today I took a deeper dive into responsive web design and breakpoints/media queries. I was mainly looking into this because in my portfolio page I feel like the nav bar "breaks" too early and turns into a toggleable button at too wide of a width. I don't think it affects user experience per se, but it was definitely something I was curious about. This also might be a function of Codepen and all the stuff it has going in the background. So I think soon I might take my project out of Codepen and starting working on it on my own computer and text editor. I read this article from Google that I thought was very informative and helpful: https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/responsive/ . I also read up a little on media queries through w3 schools. The amount of resources out there is a little overwhelming, to be honest. I feel like there's so much to learn and so many ways to go about it that sometimes I am not sure what to pick! Right now I am going to keep plugging away at my portfolio site.

I am also still trying to get my tribute-page to appear on github pages. I think I found the way I could reset it. I made a bad commit and I think I need to revert. But after that I'm a little lost. We'll see!
