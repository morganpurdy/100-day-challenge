# 100-day-challenge
## Day 1
Today I am just working on finishing up some lessons I started in Codecademy. I did the git series and want to wrap up the command line since I decided to tackle the developer way of putting things in github.
I am just trying to get used to using a new text editor and getting the feel back for the command line. I used to know it so much better! Once I wrap up the command line lessons I am going to jump into freecodecamp.org and work through their HTML/CSS lessons.


## Day 2
On day two I am just continuing with the command line lessons in Codecademy. I am learning about input and output redirections and creating an environment in the terminal. I am hoping to finish up this module today and start with the freecodecamp.org lessons tomorrow!

## Day 3
Today I finished the command line lessons in Codecademy! Very excited to be done with that and to head into the freecodecamp.org lessons. I started on those before the challenge since I was already a little familiar with HTML and CSS. Looks like tomorrow I will start with "Nest Many Elements within a Single Div Element". I'm excited! Can't wait to get through the HTML/CSS part though to get onto the next chunk, which is Responsive Design with Bootstrap!

## Day 4
What a day! Had to squeeze in some coding time around other activities so did some work while at the mechanic today. Not a lot to report so only a quick update tonight. I did get through the end of the HTML/CSS lessons on freecodecamp.org though! That is exciting enough. I started in on the responsive design section and I am excited to review what I learned tomorrow and dive even deeper. It is not as complicated as I remember it! I do think I will have to do extra reviewing on the column system set up though.
