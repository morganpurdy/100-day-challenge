# 100-day-challenge
## Day 1
Today I am just working on finishing up some lessons I started in Codecademy. I did the git series and want to wrap up the command line since I decided to tackle the developer way of putting things in github.
I am just trying to get used to using a new text editor and getting the feel back for the command line. I used to know it so much better! Once I wrap up the command line lessons I am going to jump into freecodecamp.org and work through their HTML/CSS lessons.


## Day 2
On day two I am just continuing with the command line lessons in Codecademy. I am learning about input and output redirections and creating an environment in the terminal. I am hoping to finish up this module today and start with the freecodecamp.org lessons tomorrow!

## Day 3
Today I finished the command line lessons in Codecademy! Very excited to be done with that and to head into the freecodecamp.org lessons. I started on those before the challenge since I was already a little familiar with HTML and CSS. Looks like tomorrow I will start with "Nest Many Elements within a Single Div Element". I'm excited! Can't wait to get through the HTML/CSS part though to get onto the next chunk, which is Responsive Design with Bootstrap!

## Day 4
What a day! Had to squeeze in some coding time around other activities so did some work while at the mechanic today. Not a lot to report so only a quick update tonight. I did get through the end of the HTML/CSS lessons on freecodecamp.org though! That is exciting enough. I started in on the responsive design section and I am excited to review what I learned tomorrow and dive even deeper. It is not as complicated as I remember it! I do think I will have to do extra reviewing on the column system set up though.

## Day 5
Didn't get the chance to do much today but at least wanted to check in. I took a couple notes about responsive design with bootstrap but I plan on really putting in some time tomorrow!

## Day 6
Today I finsihed up the freecodecamp.org lessons on Responsive design and bootstrap! It's amazing how much you can do with bootstrap and how simple it can make things. I did have a couple questions as I was working through some of the lessons. The first was with the columns to build in a bootstrap grid.
**1. How do you decide when to use each grid size?**
In the lesson I was working with a simulated phone screen, so I used the xs size. And it said (I think) md (medium) is used for laptop screens. But how do I decide which one to use? A couple lessons later the span tag was mentioned. It did say that span can help you style different parts of the same element differently. **But why use a span tag over a div class or div id?** Just some thoughts. Maybe it will become more clear as I continue. Can't wait to start on the jQuery lessons tomorrow!

## Day 7
I took a short dive into jQuery today! I feel like I didn't have enough time and attention to focus on it so I'm going to come back to some lessons tomorrow. I think I understand more about span vs. div class and div id question I was wondering about yesterday. Definitely the id part! Not sure about class vs. span still. I am finally off work tomorrow so I will have more time to dedicate to coding, yay!

## Day 8
This morning I have already worked through all the jQuery lessons in freecodecamp! That means I am about to start on my first true self-coded project next. I will be building a **TRIBUTE PAGE**. I will be working on it in CodePen, which I have never used before. But I am excited. In order to complete the challenge I have to meet the following requirements/user stories (? something I am reading more about today too) on my Tribute page:
1. User Story: I can view a tribute page with an image and text.
2. User Story: I can click on a link that will take me to an external website with further information on the topic.

It says next: "Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck." Even though troubleshooting may seem boring, I am also looking forward to working through any issues that may arise while I am working on my project. Being able to google the right things and solve a problem is a crucial step to becoming a developer! Can't wait to get started on the Tribute page.

Tonight I worked on coding my tribute page. I decided to dedicate my page to Naomi Parker Fraley, the real life inspiration behind Rosie the Riveter! As I have been working I came across some things I wanted to note here to come back to later. At first, I had trouble making the main image both responsive AND centered. Seemed like it should be simple! I had the class of img-responsive, center-block, and smaller-img (one I had set earlier to fix the size of the image since it was so large). Img-responsive was not making my image be responsive. I am still not sure what that was about. But I changed the class to img-fluid instead and that made it responsive! It still wasn't centering properly, however. Then it dawned on me! The smaller-img class had set the size earlier to be fixed at 500px. Once I removed that, I had a responsive image that always was centered and filled the frame. I still wonder about having a smaller image that would be always centered AND responsive. I'm not sure that's a thing people want? Like in responsive land, it would size down but maybe not size up over a certain width but then remain centered at that width? I'm not sure. But I was glad to work through this small issue.

Either way, I hope to finish up my tribute page tomorrow after sleeping on it for a bit!

## Day 9
Today I finished a thing! Last night I started on Tribute Page as part of challenge for Freecodecamp. It is pretty basic and only had two requirements: The user can view a tribute page with an image and text, and they can click on a link that will take  them to a new page for more information. I finished it up today after some more tweaks this morning. I did discover an answer to a question I had yesterday. Img-responsive is now Img-fluid in Bootstrap 4. So that explains why that wasn't working. I figured out how to keep my image centered at wider screen widths too! It's not a perfect project but I think it is definitely a good accomplishment for my first one.

Up next is building a **PERSONAL PORTFOLIO WEBSITE**. Honestly this is what I was looking most forward to entering the freecodecamp program and this 100 day challenge. At first the example looks a little daunting. But I am excited to jump in! Here are the requirements/user stories:
1. User Story: I can access all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling.
2. User Story: I can click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages.
3. User Story: I can see thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built (if you haven't built any websites before, use placeholders.)
4. User Story: I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.

Those seem like some tricky requirements! But I am looking forward to giving it a shot.

## Day 10
Today I started working on my portfolio website! It is going to be a lot more in depth and intense than the tribute page. I spent a significant amount of time today working on the nav bar. I had to use several resources to help me through it, including the Bootstrap documentation and w3 schools, another really helpful website! After some reading, and copy and pasting, I finally got one up and working. I want to take a deeper look at it another day though to make sure I understand how (most of it at least) works, rather than just relying on copying and pasting some code.  

## Day 11
I did not have a lot of time to work on coding today. I squeezed in some time at work and added on to my portfolio site. I added a couple sections including web examples, contact and about me. In the contact area I am adding a form section that I intend to use as an area that people viewing my portfolio can reach out to me. I added three fields with text, including 'name', 'subject', and 'message'. I plan to improve it in the next couple days.

## Day 12
I like to check in every day because it kind of forces me to do something worth writing about. So today in the little down time at work I had, I looked a little more into contact forms in Bootstrap. I tweaked the contact form a little on my portfolio page. I learned that the form-control class makes the form part take up 100% of the width of wherever it is. So that's cool! I also made the "message" part of my form be 'textarea' as opposed to 'input' so it could appear deeper. Just little things, but one step at a time.


## Day 14
So I missed out working on any coding yesterday. It was just a busy day! And I had hardly any time today to do anything but I squeezed in a little work. I added to the "about me" portion of my portfolio page. I summarized my experience and then I wanted to add Font Awesome social media buttons, but those gave me trouble. Haven't been able to solve that yet. I am wondering if Codepen is just a little weird about them? I don't think I'll have a ton of time tonight or tomorrow to figure it out. But then I am off Monday and Tuesday so I hope to take advantage of those days!

## Day 15
Today I spent my hour chatting with other people involved with the 100 day challenge. It was really cool to hear about their experiences and what they are learning about and building. The two people I talked to are involved with coding programs in school or online. It makes me think more about the industry and its challenges, but in a good way I think. I feel inspired and rededicated to the challenge after a day like today! I am excited I have tomorrow off to spend some time getting back to my portfolio site. The few bugs I am focused on working out are:
* Making images actually appear not just on my personal computer. Right now I link to them through a dropbox account. Could it be in privacy settings?
* Figuring out how to set up a form. It must involve a database of some sort. But it would be cool to get to the bottom of that!
* Using Font awesome icons to link to my social media accounts on my portfolio. There was a lesson on the icons in Freecodecamp but it's not working quite right in Codepen.

Maybe tomorrow I can also look up some articles about being a self-taught coder/developer! Maybe that will encourage me a little more each day.

## Day 16
I solved two of the problems I noted yesterday with my portfolio site! First- the images I was hosting through Dropbox weren't showing up because of a privacy setting, sort of as I suspected. Dropbox changed the way they do their public folders so that won't work anymore. I did a quick search for "free image hosting" and found an uploader that seems to be working for now, but we'll see. Seems like just a quick fix for now, I will want to look for a betters solution in the future. Second- those pesky Font awesome icons. So I had linked to font awesome through the CSS and Javascript setting section in Codepen. And it still wasn't working. But after starting at the Font Awesome home page, I saw a link that was for "Use Font Awesome Free CDN". It was a script tag, so I pasted it in the HTML "head stuff" setting in Codepen, and BOOM! The icons appeared. The different ways of using Font Awesome are all a little jargon-y for me, like 'content delivery network' vs. SVG with JS (why I thought I needed to link to it in the Javascript section too) vs. downloading it. But the point is, it works for now!

Going through Codepen and FreeCodeCamp though, I think they do a small disservice to users by not going over the fundamentals of an HTML document from the start, like DOCTYPE and how to link to a stylesheet. In Codepen you just start right away with Divs and containers and other tags/classes because the Head stuff is just out of sight, out of mind. But the head data/stuff it is an important part of starting an HTML document from scratch. Just a thought.

Going forward, **here are a few more things I want to do on my portfolio site:**
* Add more of the projects I did in college to the "web examples" portion of my site. This will mean figuring out how to get them to Github and doing a github project page for them! Right now they are only displaying in Safari so that is a little confusing to me.
* Figuring out that contact form! I think for now I will just have to sit tight with the appearance of a contact form. Seems like I could actually get it to function once I get into the Javascript part of the FreeCodeCamp challenges.
* Understanding more about the collapsable nav bar. Today I noticed it collapses correctly and actually displays a drop down menu when you click the button. I'm not sure how that happened. Maybe a certain class I added today helped? I want to look more into the collapsing and breakpoints and such.

## Day 17
I bounced around a little today with what I was focusing on. Weirdly whatever issue was causing my old projects not to load in chrome was fine today! Everything popped up and worked. So I added another project to my "web examples" part of my portfolio. It is a map graphic I built for the print paper in college that I transferred to online to practice my coding skills. It uses tooltips to indicate different areas of Missouri that were in a drought at the time. When hovered over, the dot displays the city and a picture of that city. Very cool! I played around with some of the code today as a refresher. The only issue I am having is that the tooltips aren't responsive? If that's a thing. The image it is built off of will size down but then the tool tips are not on the right location. I think I will have to come back to that after some more Javascript maybe.

The other thing I worked on today was publishing my Tribute page on github pages. I think I did it wrong. I feel like it shouldn't be this complicated, but I can't get my Tribute page to publish. I have been troubleshooting a little but haven't been able to get to the bottom of it. I am going to continue working on that today in the hopes that I can figure it out.

## Day 18
Today I took a deeper dive into responsive web design and breakpoints/media queries. I was mainly looking into this because in my portfolio page I feel like the nav bar "breaks" too early and turns into a toggleable button at too wide of a width. I don't think it affects user experience per se, but it was definitely something I was curious about. This also might be a function of Codepen and all the stuff it has going in the background. So I think soon I might take my project out of Codepen and starting working on it on my own computer and text editor. I read this article from Google that I thought was very informative and helpful: https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/responsive/ . I also read up a little on media queries through w3 schools. The amount of resources out there is a little overwhelming, to be honest. I feel like there's so much to learn and so many ways to go about it that sometimes I am not sure what to pick! Right now I am going to keep plugging away at my portfolio site.

I am also still trying to get my tribute-page to appear on github pages. I think I found the way I could reset it. I made a bad commit and I think I need to revert. But after that I'm a little lost. We'll see!  

## Day 19
Earlier this morning I spent some time looking more in to Git. I think I may have to give up on being able to solve my Tribute page problem myself. Seems like coding is a lot of learning by doing. So I really just tried a bunch of different things on my repository in Git to try to solve my problem. It was a public repository but not one other people were looking at so I felt okay just trying all the things! And none of them worked. So this weekend I am meeting up with my code friends and I am hoping they can help. I think I need to start from scratch and if I have someone going over the steps with me I will feel more confident. Looking forward to Sunday!

In the meantime, I think I am going to submit my portfolio page to FreeCodeCamp. It meets all the requirements for the challenge. However, it doesn't meet my requirements. So I think I am going to submit it so I can continue with Javascript lessons so I can make my portfolio even better on my own!

Side note: I found this article I'm going to leave here to hopefully come back to and read: https://coderwall.com/p/wpjw4w/change-the-bootstrap-navbar-breakpoint .

## Day 21
So I missed out on doing any coding work yesterday. And today I didn't have much time to devote to it. I'm a little behind lately. I did submit my portfolio project to FreeCodeCamp so I could proceed with the Javascript sections. Woot! The very first lesson was on commenting out Javascript but then it launched right into variables, strings, data and the seven data types. I really want to take notes on this section so I think I'm going to tackle it more on Monday/Tuesday. Tomorrow my hour will be devoted to chatting with my fellow coders in the challenge!

## Day 22
Today! So much great progress today. I finally figured out how to publish my tribute page on github! At the coding meetup I walked through the steps of pushing my new tribute page repository to Github. Then, on a hunch, I just set project page to publish from the Master branch. After some waiting-- success! You can find it at https://morganpurdy.github.io/tribute-page/ . So I am not sure what the other directions are meant to do but nothing more is needed than to go to your github settings. I think I am going to add a footer to the tribute page that links directory to the repository as well.

Then, later in the day I started in on some Javascript lessons. I didn't realize how much math you can do with Javascript. I wonder how much of Javascript is doing that. I proceeded into compound assignments. THEN I came upon my first real challenge that stumped me. It was writing a solution in Javascript to convert Celsius to fahrenheit. I thought I wouldn't be able to figure it out. I realized that you have to think like a computer: very logically! Here is the code:

```Javascript
function convertToF(celsius) {
  var fahrenheit;
  // Only change code below this line (written by me)
  fahrenheit = celsius*1.8+32;

  // Only change code above this line
  return fahrenheit;
}

// Change the inputs below to test your code
convertToF(30);
```
It was literally just writing out the conversion. I don't know why that was so hard for me but I was really glad to figure it out.

## Day 23
For my hour today, I worked through a bunch of Javascript lessons in FreeCodeCamp. I learned about strings, literal quotes in strings, and a funky thing called concatenating, which is a way of linking strings together. The basic lesson just had me link two strings together using +, in this case the concatenation operator. There must be a use for this when you wouldn't want to type it all together. One way it is useful I learned is if you use += to concatenate a string onto the end of an existing variable. I also built a small madlib game in FreeCodeCamp to practice my skills! I think that was really good practice for understanding variables and concatenation.

Today I also learned about bracket notation in Javascript and how you can use it to find the length of a string or a certain character in a string.

Additionally, I got into arrays a little! I vaguely remember arrays from college and I feel like they are very important.

## Day 24
Wow! I feel like I covered a lot of important concepts in the FreeCodeCamp lessons today. I worked through Javascript some more and learned about Javascript functions, passing, arguments and global and local variables. I did get stuck on one lesson today. The idea was that there was a function with an array (arr) and a number (item). You were supposed to write code that would add a number onto the end of the array and remove the first element from the array, then return the removed element. Right away I realized I needed to use .push() and .shift(). So I got that far at least. After that I was stuck. I did realize item needed to be inside .push() and 0 needed to be in .shift() because of the zero indexing (or so I thought on that last part). Then I was lost. I looked at the hints and tried to figure it out, but no luck. So here is the solution:

``` Javascript

function nextInLine(arr, item) {
  // Your code here
  arr.push(item);

  return arr.shift();  // Change this line
}

// Test Setup
var testArr = [1,2,3,4,5];

// Display Code
console.log("Before: " + JSON.stringify(testArr));
console.log(nextInLine(testArr, 6)); // Modify this line to test
console.log("After: " + JSON.stringify(testArr));
```

I feel good that I was able to figure out the basic concepts needed to solve the problem, but wish I could have figured it out on my own without having to look at the solution. It is all very logical and makes sense, after the fact of course. I feel like also maybe being out in the real world/wild/coding something for myself I could have figured this out. Using arbitrary values like "arr" and "item" sometimes makes it harder to solve problems I think. Or at least that's what I'm telling myself.

Anyway, I marched forward and also learned about Booleans and a bunch of different equality operators! Those seem  pretty straight forward at least. The next lessons involve else statements, so that will be interesting.

## Day 26
Today I took a short dive into else statements. I learned that when the condition for an if statement is true, the code will be executed. But when the condition is false, normally nothing would happen. However, with an else statement, an alternate block of code can be executed. You can even go a step further. If multiple conditions need to be addressed, you can use "else if" statements, which you can chain together.

I ended today on writing a Golf code function. It returned a certain string based on the strokes. For example...
``` Javascript
  if (strokes == 1){
    return  "Hole-in-one!";
  }
  else if (strokes <= par - 2){
    return "Eagle";
  }
```
... and so on.

At first, the code didn't pass and I wasn't sure why. Then I after some searching, I realized I had been using the assignment operator, =, instead of the equality operator, ==. After changing all the =s to ==, I was able to proceed.

## Day 27
I didn't have a lot of extra time to spend on coding stuff today but I did get to try out Javascript switch statements. These statements execute certain blocks of code depending on different cases. I think I read that they are also kind of interchangeable with if/else statements. So I kind of wonder what circumstances would definitely call for one or the other. Maybe that will become clear down the road. The lesson on FreeCodeCamp for the switch statement was kind of confusing. The structure goes (based on pseudocode from the site):

``` Javascript
switch (num) {
  case value1:
    statement1;
    break;
  case value2:
    statement2;
    break;
...
  case valueN:
    statementN;
    break;
}
```
I was messing up the statement part each time that was keeping me from moving on in the lessons. The FreeCodeCamp lesson mentioned the strict equality operator when that really wasn't needed in the code solution. All that was needed was the assignment operator. I was stuck for a little bit, but after doing some Googling and finding a good w3 schools description, I was able to pass that step, which felt good!

## Day 29
Didn't get to check in yesterday so I am trying to make up for that today! This morning I worked through some more lessons on switch statements, returning boolean values from functions and replacing if/else statements with switch. I did learn that sometimes switch statements are handy when trying to chain together many if/else statements. Like if you are trying to do one for ranges, where 1-3 would return the same thing, 4-6, etc. So that's good to know!

Then I have come to a lesson called "counting cards". I have seem some complaints around about this lesson on the 100 days social media accounts where I think maybe some people have been getting stuck. I went into it with an optimistic mindset but I am still having some trouble! The object of the lesson is to write a card counting function. In the end it should return a string with the current count and "bet" or "hold" depending on if the count is odd, even, or zero. I set it up as a switch statement based on the table given for the challenge. I was right away able to make it return "hold" or "bet". But returning the count is tricky for me. I am relying on the Read/Search/Ask methodology here. I really would like to finish this challenge without looking at the "get a hint" section on FreeCodeCamp. So far, I have had some success! I remembered a little about incrementing/decrementing numbers in Javascript and I know that has to come into play somewhere. There is a global count variable that I am setting up as either "count++" or "count--" but right now it is only returning null. Which actually is a success in and of itself because at first I could only get hold/bet to appear. Then after more googling I learned that to print two values, it needs to be set up as an array. So here is the code I have right now (I want to include it so I can come back later when I have gotten past this challenge):

``` Javascript
var count = 0;

function cc(card) {
  // Only change code below this line
  switch (card){
    case 2:
    case 3:
    case 4:
    case 5:
    case 6:
     answer = [card++ , "Bet"];
     break;

    case 7:
    case 8:
    case 9:
      answer = [card, "Hold"];
      break;

    case 10:
    case "J":
    case "Q":
    case "K":
    case "A":
      answer = [card--, "Hold"];
      break;


  }

  return answer;
  // Only change code above this line
}

// Add/remove calls to test your function.
// Note: Only the last will display
cc(2); cc(3); cc(7); cc('K'); cc('A');

```

To anyone else looking at this maybe the solution is obvious, but I am still working it out! I hope to update this later when I get to the bottom of it.

While I was at it today I took some notes on Javascript wording. I think the jargon sometimes gets me confused, especially when I get the same error message a lot and I'm not sure what it really means!

UPDATE: so after some consideration, I have changed the above code. I really think 'answer' needs to be count++, count or count-- since that is what's incrementing or decrementing. Still hasn't solved the problem but maybe I am closer...

## Day 30
A month in! Feels good to have made it this far. Today I continued with Javascript lessons. So I have an answer from yesterday's challenge. Here is the correct code:

``` Javascript
var count = 0;

function cc(card) {
  // Only change code below this line
switch(card){
    case 2:
    case 3:
    case 4:
    case 5:
    case 6:
     count++;
     break;
    case 10:
    case "J":
    case "Q":
    case "K":
    case "A":
      count--;
      break;
}

  if (count > 0){
    answer = count + " Bet";
  }

  else {
    answer = count + " Hold";

  }

  return answer;
  // Only change code above this line
}

```

So I was close... ish yesterday. I was right when I realized I needed to use count instead of card in the switch statement. I just wasn't on the right track when it came to returning the second half of the problem, bet vs. hold. I thought I could set it all up in the switch statement, but I guess you can't. You have to set up an if/else statement for that. I figured that out after looking at a hint for the problem. In hindsight I understand how it works but it did stump me while I was working on it.

Anyway, today I started working with javascript objects. They are kind of like arrays but are different in that you use properties to access/modify the data. So I learned about that, and using the dot operator and bracket notation to add to and modify the properties. Then I came to a lesson called "Using objects for lookups". Objects can be an alternative to switch statements and if/else statements if you have a certain kind of data. For this challenge I had to rewrite the switch statement into a lookup table. I was able to get that setup just fine, but returning the correct answer was really throwing me off. There was a "return result;" line at the end of the code block so I knew I had to have a result = 'something'. That is where I was uncertain. I tried some combos of lookup.val, val.lookup, etc. (val being what I was looking up and lookup the name of the object). None of that worked. I was really stuck on using the dot operator because one message popped up saying that was the best way to do it. Then the answer turned out to be "result = lookup[val];". So I was circling around the right place for a while which feels good.

As I have been working through some of these lessons, I feel like I have a tendency to complicate some of the coding when I don't need to. Especially on that counting cards challenge. Going forward I want to keep in mind that code can be pretty literal, (example: result above really just saying "lookup the value" but with brackets). So I hope I can start trying to think in a different mindset when it comes to some of these challenges.

## Day 31
Last night I made the decision that I would take a break from some of the FreeCodeCamp lessons today to actually work on some things. I decided I wanted to spruce up my portfolio page a little bit. I was thinking about how I wanted it look going forward and decided I wanted to have a landing page type layout that when scrolled would reveal the rest of the page. (If that makes sense. It's harder to describe in words.) I also wanted a navbar that was not at the top of the page initially but upon scrolling turned sticky. I picked out a tutorial last night and got up and watched it this morning. It is from Team Tree House and it was posted almost 4 years ago. So I watched it, everything made sense, and I dove into my project. It involved adding some specific classes and some jquery that basically said, IF scrolling and reaching certain point, .addClass of main-nav (the nav bar) ELSE .removeClass. That made sense and even brought back some of my early knowledge from jquery lessons. However, that didn't work out. I tried to match my code as best I could to that but it wouldn't do what I wanted. (In hindsight maybe I just had some files in the wrong place. But I'll get to that.)  

THEN I found this w3schools page (https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_navbar_sticky.asp) that explained it and made it super simple, even more so than the tutorial video I watched. So I added the .sticky class to my css, added what they had for javascript, doing window onScroll, and also adding and removing classes. STILL didn't work. I could get the crossover and everything, but my nav bar would not stick to the top. I was frustrated. But then I realized in the script it uses getElementById("navbar");. In my HTML, navbar was only a class, not an id as well. So I added an ID navbar and TADA. It worked! (I should note, after having moved the script tags for my script and javascript to the bottom of my HTML document). I have a page that starts with a header, and with scrolling you can see the rest of my portfolio but the nav bar sticks to the top. I want to style it better going forward. Right now it's pretty plain so I may try adding an image. But I feel good having figured that out.

## Day 32
Today I spent a little more time tweaking my portfolio page and working more on some HTML/CSS. I had a great revelation about columns in Bootstrap! You can set multiple column widths per element, example div class ="col-md-4 col-sm-6" for different layouts. So that's cool! I think I have had a nice break from just going through lessons on FreeCodeCamp. I feel more engaged this way and like I'm getting things done. I think I should starting brainstorming some ideas for projects using Javascript skills I learned! That way I feel more involved in my learning and I think it will reinforce concepts for me. So let the brainstorming begin!

## Day 33
I worked a little more on some real life HTML/CSS code to adjust a mockup. I have been learning a lot between that and working on my own portfolio page some more. I have been a little distracted lately though and not able to focus fully on any FreeCodeCamp lessons since to me they take a fair amount of concentration. I will be getting back to those probably later this week. I need to decide what kind of practical use I want to try out with my Javascript skills. I am wondering if I would be able to figure out how to get the contact form on my portfolio in better, working order. I will try to read up on that.

## Day 34
The second half of my weeks have been tricky to get in any coding time lately! I have had to resort mainly to reading over the last couple of days. I have read a lot about some HTML and CSS basics and other coding topics, including what tools some people wish they had when they first started coding and just straightforward industry advice.

 I work really well with to do lists so I am going to list here some things I hope to accomplish over the next couple of days:
* Work more on my portfolio site for practice
* Try out some media queries in the css for my portfolio site so I improve my knowledge about them
* Proceed with FreeCodeCamp Javascript lessons. Those have come to a halt as of late.

## Day 36
So I missed out on doing any coding work yesterday. But I am trying to make up for it by getting some stuff done from my list two days ago. I accomplished the first item at least. I worked on my portfolio site with the intention of changing the color of the list items in my navbar when I hovered over them. While I have not achieved that today, I did change another hover color, kind of by accident! At the bottom of my CSS I had an a selector that was set to "color: inherit". I added a couple more lines and voila! The social media icons at the bottom of my portfolio page now change color when hovered on. So that's cool, but wasn't my original intention. Still figuring out the list item thing!

Oh! And I also kind of solved a problem I had been having with the navbar itself. When viewed in the "inspect" view and in responsive mode, the dropdown wasn't working. I saw an error message noting some scripts I was missing so I added those, and it works now! It still doesn't look right when it actually drops down but it's a step in the right direction.

Oh, part two! I figured out the list item thing. Duh! So Bootstrap has a hover color originally but I wanted to change it to more suit my personality and site design. So I added "!important" (used sparingly) and BOOM! My list items appear purple when hovered over now.

## Day 37
Today my coding time was spent with my fellow code challengers! We try to all get together once a week to share what we are up to in the process. There's so much excitement going on in our group, from new jobs to schools to projects, and it's awesome.  It's such a cool time to absorb new ideas and get help if needed. Tomorrow I will be back at it with hands on coding and lessons!

## Day 38
I got in some more coding tonight! For practice mainly I decided I wanted to add an image to my site header and have my text on top of that. And then when user scroll past that they see the rest of my site with the sticky nav bar. I had some trouble originally. I was using a z-index but it wasn't working right for me. After some Googling I figured it out: only elements with certain positions can also hold a z-index. So that helped but then the text wasn't appearing where I wanted it to. After some more messing around I added a <section> tag, which I have never utilized before, instead of attaching this particular code to the <body> and it worked like a charm! Yay! Then looking at in the smaller mode with the dev tools I realize what I have done may not be totally smart phone friendly, which is a bummer. It required setting a specific height on the header image that looks good on big screens, but I think turns out to be too deep on smart phones. We'll see. I'll have to think on what I want to do about that!

I did, however, add an animation to my page, and it was super simple! I linked animate.css and added a "fadeInLeft" and it was so easy and adds a nice touch I think. Cool discovery to help me practice things!
