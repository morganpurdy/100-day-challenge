# 100-day-challenge
## Day 1
Today I am just working on finishing up some lessons I started in Codecademy. I did the git series and want to wrap up the command line since I decided to tackle the developer way of putting things in github.
I am just trying to get used to using a new text editor and getting the feel back for the command line. I used to know it so much better! Once I wrap up the command line lessons I am going to jump into freecodecamp.org and work through their HTML/CSS lessons.


## Day 2
On day two I am just continuing with the command line lessons in Codecademy. I am learning about input and output redirections and creating an environment in the terminal. I am hoping to finish up this module today and start with the freecodecamp.org lessons tomorrow!

## Day 3
Today I finished the command line lessons in Codecademy! Very excited to be done with that and to head into the freecodecamp.org lessons. I started on those before the challenge since I was already a little familiar with HTML and CSS. Looks like tomorrow I will start with "Nest Many Elements within a Single Div Element". I'm excited! Can't wait to get through the HTML/CSS part though to get onto the next chunk, which is Responsive Design with Bootstrap!

## Day 4
What a day! Had to squeeze in some coding time around other activities so did some work while at the mechanic today. Not a lot to report so only a quick update tonight. I did get through the end of the HTML/CSS lessons on freecodecamp.org though! That is exciting enough. I started in on the responsive design section and I am excited to review what I learned tomorrow and dive even deeper. It is not as complicated as I remember it! I do think I will have to do extra reviewing on the column system set up though.

## Day 5
Didn't get the chance to do much today but at least wanted to check in. I took a couple notes about responsive design with bootstrap but I plan on really putting in some time tomorrow!

## Day 6
Today I finsihed up the freecodecamp.org lessons on Responsive design and bootstrap! It's amazing how much you can do with bootstrap and how simple it can make things. I did have a couple questions as I was working through some of the lessons. The first was with the columns to build in a bootstrap grid.
**1. How do you decide when to use each grid size?**
In the lesson I was working with a simulated phone screen, so I used the xs size. And it said (I think) md (medium) is used for laptop screens. But how do I decide which one to use? A couple lessons later the span tag was mentioned. It did say that span can help you style different parts of the same element differently. **But why use a span tag over a div class or div id?** Just some thoughts. Maybe it will become more clear as I continue. Can't wait to start on the jQuery lessons tomorrow!

## Day 7
I took a short dive into jQuery today! I feel like I didn't have enough time and attention to focus on it so I'm going to come back to some lessons tomorrow. I think I understand more about span vs. div class and div id question I was wondering about yesterday. Definitely the id part! Not sure about class vs. span still. I am finally off work tomorrow so I will have more time to dedicate to coding, yay!

## Day 8
This morning I have already worked through all the jQuery lessons in freecodecamp! That means I am about to start on my first true self-coded project next. I will be building a **TRIBUTE PAGE**. I will be working on it in CodePen, which I have never used before. But I am excited. In order to complete the challenge I have to meet the following requirements/user stories (? something I am reading more about today too) on my Tribute page:
1. User Story: I can view a tribute page with an image and text.
2. User Story: I can click on a link that will take me to an external website with further information on the topic.

It says next: "Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck." Even though troubleshooting may seem boring, I am also looking forward to working through any issues that may arise while I am working on my project. Being able to google the right things and solve a problem is a crucial step to becoming a developer! Can't wait to get started on the Tribute page.

Tonight I worked on coding my tribute page. I decided to dedicate my page to Naomi Parker Fraley, the real life inspiration behind Rosie the Riveter! As I have been working I came across some things I wanted to note here to come back to later. At first, I had trouble making the main image both responsive AND centered. Seemed like it should be simple! I had the class of img-responsive, center-block, and smaller-img (one I had set earlier to fix the size of the image since it was so large). Img-responsive was not making my image be responsive. I am still not sure what that was about. But I changed the class to img-fluid instead and that made it responsive! It still wasn't centering properly, however. Then it dawned on me! The smaller-img class had set the size earlier to be fixed at 500px. Once I removed that, I had a responsive image that always was centered and filled the frame. I still wonder about having a smaller image that would be always centered AND responsive. I'm not sure that's a thing people want? Like in responsive land, it would size down but maybe not size up over a certain width but then remain centered at that width? I'm not sure. But I was glad to work through this small issue.

Either way, I hope to finish up my tribute page tomorrow after sleeping on it for a bit!

## Day 9
Today I finished a thing! Last night I started on Tribute Page as part of challenge for Freecodecamp. It is pretty basic and only had two requirements: The user can view a tribute page with an image and text, and they can click on a link that will take  them to a new page for more information. I finished it up today after some more tweaks this morning. I did discover an answer to a question I had yesterday. Img-responsive is now Img-fluid in Bootstrap 4. So that explains why that wasn't working. I figured out how to keep my image centered at wider screen widths too! It's not a perfect project but I think it is definitely a good accomplishment for my first one.

Up next is building a **PERSONAL PORTFOLIO WEBSITE**. Honestly this is what I was looking most forward to entering the freecodecamp program and this 100 day challenge. At first the example looks a little daunting. But I am excited to jump in! Here are the requirements/user stories:
1. User Story: I can access all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling.
2. User Story: I can click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages.
3. User Story: I can see thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built (if you haven't built any websites before, use placeholders.)
4. User Story: I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.

Those seem like some tricky requirements! But I am looking forward to giving it a shot.
